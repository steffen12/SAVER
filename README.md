# SAVER

SAVER (Single-cell Analysis Via Expression Recovery) implements a regularized regression prediction and an empirical Bayes method to recover the true gene expression profile in noisy and sparse single-cell RNA-seq data.

## News and Updates
September 19, 2017
* Version 0.3.0 released.

August 13, 2017
* Version 0.2.2 released.

## Installation

You can install SAVER from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mohuangx/SAVER")
```

## saver Example

We will demonstrate the ```saver``` function using the ```linnarsson``` dataset.

```R
data("linnarsson")

# predictions for top 5 highly expressed genes
saver1 <- saver(linnarsson, npred = 5)

# predictions for certain genes
genes <- c("Thy1", "Mbp", "Stim2", "Psmc6", "Rps19")
genes.ind <- which(rownames(linnarsson) %in% genes)
saver2 <- saver(linnarsson, pred.genes = genes.ind)

# run predictions for all genes
saver3 <- saver(linnarsson)

# run in parallel
library(doParallel)
registerDoParallel(cores = 4)
saver4 <- saver(linnarsson, parallel = TRUE)
```

Recovered normalized expression estimates are stored in the ```estimate``` element of the returned ```saver``` object.

Library-size normalization is performed by default. If the input expression matrix is already normalized or normalization is not desired, use the option ```size.factor = 1```. A vector of other size factors can also be assigned to the ```size.factor``` argument.

## Sampling example

Oftentimes for downstream analysis, you may want to sample from the posterior distributions to account for estimation uncertainty. This is similar to performing multiple imputation to obtain multiple imputed datasets. To sample from the posterior distributions, we use the function ```sample.saver```, which takes in the ```saver``` result and outputs sampled datasets. For example,

```R
samp1 <- sample.saver(saver1, rep = 1, seed = 50)
samp5 <- sample.saver(saver1, rep = 5, seed = 50)
```

## Correlation example

Because the SAVER estimates contain uncertainty, correlations between genes and cells cannot be directly calculated using the SAVER estimates. To adjust for the uncertainty, we provide the functions ```cor.genes``` and ```cor.cells``` to construct gene-to-gene and cell-to-cell correlation matrices respectively for the SAVER output. These functions take in the ```saver``` result and outputs the gene-to-gene or cell-to-cell correlation matrix. For example,

```R
saver1.cor.gene <- cor.genes(saver1)
saver1.cor.cell <- cor.cells(saver1)
```
